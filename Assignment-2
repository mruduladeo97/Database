    1) Which field of the Customers table is the primary key?

    Ans: A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.
         Primary keys must contain unique values. A primary key column cannot have NULL values.

         A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of single or multiple fields.
         When multiple fields are used as a primary key, they are called a composite key.

         If a table has a primary key defined on any fields, then you cannot have two records having
         the same value of that field.
